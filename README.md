This will execute the program, showing outputs for scenarios with and without DI, as well as demonstrating different service lifetimes.

## Key Takeaways

- DI allows for easier testing by enabling the use of mock objects.
- It promotes loose coupling between classes and their dependencies.
- DI facilitates easier configuration changes and maintenance.
- Understanding different service lifetimes (Transient, Scoped, Singleton) is crucial for proper DI usage.
